PROBLEM: Needed a way to sort cards effectively by rank value
SOLUTION: Patrick used a mergeSort function that he learned in data structures v.impressive

PROBLEM: the player hands were being instantiated but then registered as null when sent through send info
SOLUTION: It turns out you can't use a for each loop to instantiate objects, but must instead use a regular for loop
            the hands were being only instantiated in the limited scope of the for each loop and were not being permenantly
            instantiated in the gameState

PROBLEM: sometimes the computerplayer will be making its first move but will have 12 cards instead of 13
SOLVED:  Samuel corrected the logic for Computer players determining if it was their turn to play a card

11/20/2017 - Samuel Cowdery
PROBLEM: switching the "leading player" is challenging because sometimes the computer player will sometimes think it is
        playing second or third if it is supposed to be leading.
SOLUTION Samuel made the turnInTrick variable equal to the number of cards in play

11/20/2017 - Samuel Cowdery
PROBLEM: needed to modify the playCard Button to appear green when it was the human player's turn to play
SOLUTION: Samuel found a resource online (StackOverflow) that detailed how to use a handler to manage widgets in threads


11/20/2017 - Samuel Cowdery
PROBLEM: the computer player gets a little jumpy and doesn't wait for the human player and tries to play a second time
         resulting in an index out of bounds exception
SOLUTION: via modular arithmetic, the turn of the trick is determined by something other than the # of cards on the table


11/20/2017 - Samuel Cowdery
PROBLEM: if the human player does not move his/her seekbar after playing a card, the card played is NOT removed from the hand
SOLUTION: Samuel set the selectedCard in the human player to null after playing a card

11/20/2017 - Samuel Cowdery
PROBLEM: there is a concurrent modification exception in the HumanPlayer tick method
SOLUTION: Patrick used a better method to increment through the stack of cardsInPlay


11/21/2017 - Samuel Cowdery
PROBLEM: Crashes after new round ---- try using same methodology for trick with boolean
SOLUTION: used a boolean and corrected the if statements to prevent scoreTrick & beginNewRound() from both being called

11/21/2017 - Samuel Cowdery
PROBLEM: the last card in the round sometimes cannot be played by the human player
SOLUTION: beginNewRound() was re-engineered and the bug went away

11/20/2017 - Samuel Cowdery
PROBLEM: the scoreTrick method occasionally assigns the wrong "winningPlayerIdx" for the scored trick
            and adds points to the wrong team and assigns the wrong leadPlayer to the mainState
SOLUTION: Patrick used a simple array to track which player card matches each player and properly
            assigns the winningPlayerIdx

11/21/2017 - Samuel Cowdery
PROBLEM: after creating a new round, the GUI is incorrect for the first play for the human
SOLUTION: updated the beginNewRound() method

11/21/2017 - Patrick Maloney
PROBLEM: Computer players can lead with a card they just used to win the previous trick
SOLUTION: Patrick removed the played card locally for each player

11/31/2017 - Andrew Harrah
PROBLEM: could not access the player names when trying to print the names by the card of the player
SOLUTION: had to look into the game framework and find the array allPlayerNames[] that I could index through

PROBLEM: occasionally, there is no delay between the first 2 computer players playing cards to start a new trick

12/03/2017
PROBLEM: ocasionally, the entire animation surface goes dark and nothing but the widgets are visible

12/03/2017
PROBLEM: If the 0 player bids low and p1 and p3 the player GUI is wrong for the first trick
